# Bootleg Social Media - Intro to JS 
<h><b> A web-based feed-like text post creation using JS</b></h>

This project is an intro to JS project I wanted to use to tinker around with JS and HTML. Essentially, the user should be able to input in text into a text box that then creates a new 'post' in the 'feed'. They can edit and delete the posts. 

Currently working to delete posts. 
Further implementation include 
- Storing the posts into a DB
- Logging in into an account
